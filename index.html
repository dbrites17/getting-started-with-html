<h1>Daniel's Notes</h1>

<p> The beginning of the internet, or the "web", is somewhere in the early <b>1990's.</b> The mark-up language, HTML, was specifically designed to help create this internet, and is basically the language used to talk from computers to request files to be viewed on <em>those</em> computers.</p>

<h2>Major Pieces</h2>

<p>The internet is made up of roughly <b>FOUR</b> pieces.<br>
  
  <p>They are: <b>Us (People), the computer, the Web, and the Servers.</b></p>
  <br>
  <h4>What this means...</h4>

<p>  For me, the easiest way to remember what HTML does is by simply thingking of it as a language that internet pages use.
This helps me understand that it will take some time as most languages do, and that I need to practice and not worry about memorizing so much as understanding the basics of HTML, much like Andy suggests!<br><br>.<img src=http://i.imgur.com/fdGeWES.png></p>
<h4>Some Key Takeaways</h4>

<p><b>Tags:</b> Some tags require closing, and some tags do not, which are considered <b>VOIDS</b>.<br>
  <b>Elements:</b> This is what an HTML is essentially made up of.<br>
  <b>Attributes:</b> Used with <em>specific</em> tags to make things act, appear, or overall just process specifically different depending on the instruction.<br>
  <b>HTML:</b> Hyper Tet Mark-up Language<br>
  <b>Inline:</b> An element that is inline with the contents.<br>
  <b>Block:</b> An element that create an invisible box that can be adjusted.
<br>
<b>Hyperlink example:</b><a href="www.google.com"> Google It!!!</a>
